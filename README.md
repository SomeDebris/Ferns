# FERNS

**a faction mod for Reassembly.**

This mod isn't playable nor is it designed to be playable.

This mod was created because ferns look cool.

No regions file.

No thought put into balance.

Fun custom shapes designed to allow the user to produce organic looking ships.

This project has been nagging at me for the longest time. I want to nip it right
now so that I don't feel bad later.

if you want to edit it, then, uhh, create a PR or something. I'll look it over and I'll add it in to this mod, would be kinda fun I guess.

I will not make any more large changes to this project, for it is done to me.
